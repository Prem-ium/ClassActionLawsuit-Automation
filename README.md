## 🔍 Overview 

The **Class Action AutoFill** tool is an **web automation script** designed to streamline the process of completing class action lawsuit claim forms. Currently, it supports some of the most commonly found landing pages, with future updates planned to expand functionality to less commonly found ones. Features such as automated payment verification are planned; for now the UI.Vision project will preform a best attempt for verification.
